      "answer": "Relationship: Pattern recognition (PR) focuses on identifying regularities in data and assigning labels or categories to observations (e.g., classification). Machine learning (ML) provides the algorithmic framework to learn these decision rules/models from data. In practice, modern PR is largely implemented using ML methods, and the two fields strongly overlap.  Origins: Both PR and ML have roots in statistics and probability (e.g., Bayesian decision theory, estimation, hypothesis testing), signal processing (feature extraction, filtering), and early artificial intelligence. Classic PR emphasized pipelines such as preprocessing → feature extraction → classifier, while ML increasingly emphasized data-driven model learning and optimization.",
